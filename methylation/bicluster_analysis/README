In this folder we do some biclustering analysis on the gene expression and methylation datasets.

We are looking to find biclusters that are interesting, for example:
- One that separates healthy vs diseased tumours.
- Biclusters that are shared between two or three of the datasets.


plot_datasets.py
    Method for plotting a heatmap of the given dataset. Plots this for the 
    three datasets, storing them in /plots/.

compute_reordering_samples_genes.py
    Runs hierarchical clustering on the gene expression dataset to find a 
    sensible reordering of the samples and genes. Stores new heatmaps in 
    /plots/, and reordered data in /data_reordered/.
    Conclusion: not an easy reordering to be found that shows biclusters.

run_hmf_mtf_store_matrices.py
    Run the HMF D-MTF model on the datasets, and store the F and S matrices in
    /matrices/.

rank_biclusters.py
    Methods for ranking the different biclusters, and returning a sorted list 
    of them. Either based on S value, total S value across different datasets,
    variance explained by each bicluster in one dataset, or total variance
    across all datasets.

plot_biclusters.py
    Plot the specified biclusters, showing only the values explained by that
    bicluster, R_kl, and store in /plots_biclusters/. 
    Also:
    - Reorder rows and columns using hierarchical clustering on R_kl.
    - Add the hierarchical clustering to the diagram.
    - Add the healthy vs diseased classification to the diagram.
